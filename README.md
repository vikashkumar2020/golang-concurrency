# golang-concurrency
This contains the basic golang concurrency related topics including go routines, sleep, sync wait group and sync mutex. 

- ### Basic
  - #### 01time_sleep
    This covers basic introduction of the goroutines and how to run them with time.sleep method.
  - #### 02wait_group
    This covers the running goroutines using the sync.wait wg method. This uses the wait group to control the goroutines.
  - #### 03testing
    This covers the writting test-cases for the goroutine and run test in golang.
  - #### 04race_condition
    This covers the identification of the race condition in the golang program using goroutines and trying to access the same resource.
  - #### 05mutex
    This covers the use of mutex to resolve the race condition which occurs the in goroutines.
  - #### 06mutex_example
    This covers an example of the go routines using wait group and mutex with goroutine based program.
